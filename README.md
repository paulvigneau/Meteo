# Meteo

Just a simple weather website.

Get the current weather and for the next 4 days.

You can:
- Search a city in the search bar with autocompleting.
- Search on the map by moving the marker.
- Get your position with geolocation.

This website uses:
- Leaflet 1.7.1 for the map with an OpenStreetMap layer.
- Bootstrap 4.5.2.
- https://prevision-meteo.ch for the weather API (only France, Belgium and Switzerland).
- https://geo.api.gouv.fr for the list of french cities and the reverse geocoding.

Because of the APIs used, this website is only useful in France, but it can be easily changed.
